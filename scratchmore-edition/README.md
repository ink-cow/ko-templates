### Source

The measures are taken from a commercial comic book art board which can be found in most art stores.

Area    | Measure
------- | -----------
Live    | 9 x 14
Trim    | 9.75 x 15.25
Bleed   | 10.25 x 15.75

Board recommends 67% reduction for print.

Your project may require different dimensions. This template merely reflects the dimensions of the commercial art board, so caveat emptor.

### Design

The commercial board design is copyrighted, but our template employs a unique arrangement of vector blocks instead of blue lines.

The drawing areas are not visibly labeled, but the layout should be intuitive. The white area in the center, divided in thirds and quarters, is the live area. All dialogue and important material should be within this boundary. The succeeding areas are the trim area and the full bleed.

The areas are however labeled as layers. To quickly trim the page, go to the TRIM layer and select TRIM TO CURRENT LAYER from the menu. If you use vector to create your borders, copy the LIVE area and begin editing the live vector block.

This template provides the basics and some possible shortcuts but doesn't want to box you into any particular way of doing things.
