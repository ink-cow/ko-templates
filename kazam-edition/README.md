The measures are taken from guidelines posted by a popular comic book resource website. The guidelines are for the final reduced print and not a full-size art board, so we do not use our work file resolution trick. 300 dpi is merely 300 dpi, etc.

Area    | Measure in inches
------- | -----------------
Live    | 6.25 x 9.75
Trim    | 6.75 x 10.25
Bleed   | 7 x 10.5

Double  | Measure in inches
------- | -----------------
Live    | 13 x 9.75
Trim    | 13.5 x 10.25
Bleed   | 13.75 x 10.5

[The website resource erroneously labels the double-page bleed area as 13.625; the trim area requires 13.75, corrected here]

Your project may require different dimensions. This template merely reflects the posted guidelines, so caveat emptor.

### Design

Our template employs a unique arrangement of vector blocks instead of blue lines.

The drawing areas are not visibly labeled, but the layout should be intuitive. The white area in the center, divided in thirds and quarters, is the live area. All dialogue and important material should be within this boundary. The succeeding areas are the trim area and the full bleed.

The areas are however labeled as layers. To quickly trim the page, go to the TRIM layer and select TRIM TO CURRENT LAYER from the menu. If you use vector to create your borders, copy the LIVE area and begin editing the live vector block.

This template provides the basics and some possible shortcuts but doesn't want to box you into any particular way of doing things.
