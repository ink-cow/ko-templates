The measures are taken from guidelines established by Tokyopop for American manga. **IMPORTANT:** unlike many of the US comic book art boards, the Tokyopop board called for 50% reduction. So you'll find that the 600 dpi template is actually set to 300, 500 dpi set to 250, etc. As with the US templates, this "working" resolution allows the board to be measured as if a full-size 11 x 17 art board, but no reduction is necessary for print.

Bleed           | 11 x 15.875

Double          | Measure in inches

Your project may require different dimensions. This template merely reflects the posted guidelines, so caveat emptor.

### Design

Our template employs a unique arrangement of vector blocks instead of blue lines.

The drawing areas are not visibly labeled, but the layout should be intuitive. The white area in the center, divided in thirds and quarters, is the live area. All dialogue and important material should be within this boundary. The succeeding areas are the trim area and the full bleed.

The areas are however labeled as layers. To quickly trim the page, go to the TRIM layer and select TRIM TO CURRENT LAYER from the menu. If you use vector to create your borders, copy the LIVE area and begin editing the live vector block.

This template provides the basics and some possible shortcuts but doesn't want to box you into any particular way of doing things.
